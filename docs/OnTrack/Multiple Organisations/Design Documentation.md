**Introduction**

This design document outlines the approach for incorporating multiple organizations into the OnTrack
server, enhancing its functionality to accommodate various organizations within a single system
instance. The goal is to provide a comprehensive solution that enables effective organization
management, user assignment, and access control while maintaining the integrity and security of the
OnTrack system.

**User Story**

As a Site administrator, I want to be able to manage multiple organizations within the OnTrack
system. This will allow me to efficiently organize users and data, ensuring that each organization
operates independently.

**Acceptance Criteria**

- Site administrators can create new organizations, providing details such as name and description.
- Organizations can be edited to update their details.
- Organizations can be disabled when they are no longer in use.
- Users can be associated with specific organizations.
- Users with access to multiple organizations can smoothly switch between them.
- Data access is restricted based on a user's associated organization.

**System Architecture -**

**Frontend Architecture:**

The frontend of the system incorporates the following components:

- Organization Management UI: This component allows administrators to create, edit, and disable
  organizations. It includes a user-friendly interface for managing organization details.
- User Management UI: Users are associated with organizations through this interface. It provides a
  seamless experience for assigning users to organizations and managing user profiles.
- Organization Switching UI: Users with access to multiple organizations can easily switch between
  them using this interface. It ensures a smooth transition from one organization's context to
  another.

**Backend Architecture:**

The backend of the system handles data management and access control:

- Organization Management: Backend services manage the creation, editing, and disabling of
  organizations. Data is stored securely in the database, and appropriate permissions are enforced.
- User Organization Assignment: Backend processes allow site administrators to associate users with
  specific organizations. These associations are maintained in the database.
- Access Control: The backend enforces access control rules to ensure that users can only access
  data within their associated organization. This is achieved through role-based access control
  mechanisms where site administrator is a new role.

**Technical Implementation-**

**Frontend Implementation:**

Organization Management UI:

- Create user interfaces for creating, editing, and disabling organizations.
- Implement forms for entering organization details.
- Ensure responsive design using modern frontend technologies.

User Management UI:

- Develop interfaces for assigning users to organizations and managing user profiles.
- Implement user-friendly features for easy association and disassociation of users with
  organizations.

Organization Switching UI:

- Create an intuitive interface for users to switch between organizations.
- Implement secure mechanisms for handling organization context switches.

**Backend Implementation:**

Organization Management:

- Develop API endpoints for creating, editing, and disabling organizations.
- Implement data validation to ensure the integrity of organization details.
- Ensure data is securely stored and updated in the database.

User Organization Assignment:

- Create API endpoints for associating and disassociating users with organizations.
- Implement validation checks to prevent unauthorized assignments.
- Update user profiles to reflect organization associations.

Access Control:

- Enforce access control rules based on user roles and organization associations.
- Implement middleware to check permissions before granting access to data.
- Securely manage data queries to ensure isolation between organizations.
- The technical implementation aims to provide a seamless user experience while ensuring data
  security and access control across multiple organizations.

**Database Design**

The database design ensures that organizations can be efficiently managed, users can be associated
with organizations, and access control can be enforced based on these associations. The database
design for incorporating multiple organizations includes the following elements:

- Organizations Table: Create a table named ‘organizations’ to store organization-specific details.

Columns:

- organization_id: Unique identifier for each organization (primary key).
- name: Name of the organization.
- description: Description of the organization.
- Email: official email id of the organization.
- is_enabled: Flag indicating whether the organization is active or disabled.

- Users Table: Update the existing ‘users’ table to include organisation_id as the foreign key.

**Error Handling and Validation**

Robust error handling and validation mechanisms are essential for ensuring data integrity and user
satisfaction. Frontend and backend components should implement validation checks and provide clear
error messages to users.

**Testing Strategy**

Testing is crucial to verify the functionality and security of the system. Both frontend and backend
components should undergo thorough testing to identify and address issues.

**Deployment Plan**

The deployment plan outlines the steps for introducing the multiple organizations feature into the
OnTrack system, ensuring a smooth transition for users.

**Conclusion**

The incorporation of multiple organizations into the OnTrack server is a significant enhancement
that enhances the system's flexibility and scalability. By following the design outlined in this
document and implementing it effectively, the OnTrack system will provide a powerful solution for
managing multiple organizations while maintaining data security and access control. This design
document serves as a roadmap for achieving these goals and delivering a feature-rich, user-friendly
system.
